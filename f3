c) The clothing store management is unsure that the probability of high demand is exactly 0.45. Using sensitivity analysis, at what value of the probability of high demand does the decision under the expected value criterion change?

Using a decision tree calculate the perfect gain in information assuming the market research company has a perfect record.
