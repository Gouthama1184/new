A clothing store has to place its order to a clothing manufacturer in autumn for the spring/summer season. Due to the large lead times, only one order can be placed in advance, and no further orders will be possible. The clothing store must decide whether to make a large or small order.
The profit it earns depends heavily on the level of demand for their products. It is unknown whether demand will be high or low, but the probability of high demand is estimated to be 0.45.
If demand is low, the store knows it will make £30,000 in profit for a small order and a loss of £10,000 for a large order. If demand is high, the store knows it will make £40,000 in profit for a small order and £70,000 for a large order.
